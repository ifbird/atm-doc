Play
=====

On the terminal, load some bash functions, cache voices and play!

```
source play.sh
cache script.sh
play script.sh
```

Recording a screencast
---------------------------

Kazam seems to work great in Ubuntu. Playback with VLC.

TODO
-----

- write 'typing' function for terminal examples
- add own 'pause' function that is skipped during caching step
- use Watson/Google/Amazon cloud voices
