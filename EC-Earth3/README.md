==================================================================

Notes and comments on building coupled climate model EC-Earth3 in the configuration used for CMIP6 AerChemMIP experiment in Cray XC40 (sisu.csc.fi) using Intel or Cray compiler suites.

The current build process using Intel and Cray compiler suites is documented in the files [build-intel.bash](build-intel.bash) and [build.bash](build.bash), respectively.
